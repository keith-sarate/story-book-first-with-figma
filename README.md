# Storybook-First with Figma

> **An installable BMad customization module that turns any Atomic-Design + Figma project into a pixel-perfect, design-driven dev pipeline.**

![Workflow diagram — Read Figma → Reuse Check → Build → Validate → Sync to Canvas](article/workflow-diagram.svg)

This repository ships a complete, opinionated dev workflow as a drop-in package:

- A **Dev Operating Manual** that the BMad dev agent loads as foundational context
- A **`bmad-dev-story` customization** (`_bmad/custom/bmad-dev-story.toml`) that enforces the workflow
- A **Figma MCP** registration (`.mcp.json`)
- A **Playwright + Figma REST** visual validation script (`scripts/visual-check.mjs`)
- The **sprint scaffolding**: five base stories (Bootstrap → Atoms Discovery → Molecules → Organisms → Screen) plus a per-atom story template generated at runtime

After install, the project's BMad dev agent follows the same five-step loop on every UI story:

**READ FIGMA → REUSE CHECK → BUILD → VALIDATE → SYNC TO CANVAS**

…gated by an automated screenshot diff between Storybook and Figma that can't be eyeballed away.

## Read the article first

The full story — why this workflow exists, how the five steps fit together, why we adopted only one of Figma's four MCP skills — is in [`article/storybook-first-with-figma.pdf`](article/storybook-first-with-figma.pdf) (also browseable as [Markdown](article/storybook-first-with-figma.md)).

## Requirements

| Tool | Minimum | Why |
|---|---|---|
| [BMad](https://docs.bmad-method.org) | core + `bmm` module | Provides `bmad-dev-story` and sprint orchestration |
| [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) | latest | MCP client for Figma |
| Node | 20+ | For `scripts/visual-check.mjs` |
| pnpm | 9+ | npm works too — substitute commands |
| Figma | account + file + personal access token | Token needed for the REST image export inside `visual:check` |

### Figma file prerequisites

The workflow only works as well as the Figma file lets it. The dev agent fishes for what's there — it can't invent structure that doesn't exist. For the workflow to be effective, your Figma file should have:

- **Variables** for colors, spacing, radii, typography (or at minimum published Styles)
- **Atomic-design organization** — distinct frames named or grouped as Atoms / Molecules / Organisms / Screen
- **Components with variant sets** for every reusable piece

If those are missing the workflow can still run, but tokens get derived from raw values and the discovery story may HALT. See the **"What your Figma file needs to have"** section in [`article/storybook-first-with-figma.pdf`](article/storybook-first-with-figma.pdf) for what happens in each degraded scenario.

## Install

### One-liner

```bash
REPO=https://github.com/keith-sarate/story-book-first-with-figma.git
git clone --depth 1 "$REPO" /tmp/sb-figma
/tmp/sb-figma/install.sh /path/to/your/project \
  --file-key  <FIGMA_FILE_KEY> \
  --file-name <figma-file-slug> \
  --atoms     <NODE_ID> \
  --molecules <NODE_ID> \
  --organisms <NODE_ID> \
  --screen    <NODE_ID>
```

Replace the `<FIGMA_FILE_KEY>` and `<NODE_ID>` placeholders below with your project's values.

### Interactive (recommended for the first run)

```bash
REPO=https://github.com/keith-sarate/story-book-first-with-figma.git
git clone --depth 1 "$REPO" /tmp/sb-figma
/tmp/sb-figma/install.sh /path/to/your/project
```

Prompts for every value, shows a summary, asks for confirmation, then writes files and prints next steps.

### As a git submodule (recommended for teams)

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
REPO=https://github.com/keith-sarate/story-book-first-with-figma.git
git submodule add "$REPO" vendor/sb-figma
vendor/sb-figma/install.sh .
```

Pins the module to a known revision; update later with `git submodule update --remote`.

## After install — five things to do

The installer prints these too; here they are for reference:

1. In Claude Code, run `/mcp` and approve the `figma` server.
2. `cp .env.example .env` in the target project and paste your Figma personal access token (mint one at [figma.com/settings](https://www.figma.com/settings) → Personal access tokens).
3. Install Playwright in the target project (the dev agent will do this on first run if you skip):
   ```bash
   pnpm i -D playwright @playwright/test dotenv
   pnpm exec playwright install chromium
   ```
4. Add to the target's `package.json` scripts:
   ```json
   "scripts": { "visual:check": "node scripts/visual-check.mjs" }
   ```
5. In Claude Code:
   ```
   > dev the next story
   ```
   That picks up `1-1-bootstrap-and-tokens.md`, sets up Vite + React + TS + Tailwind + Storybook 8, extracts your design tokens from Figma, verifies the visual-check pipeline end-to-end, and yields back.

From there, every subsequent `dev the next story` builds one atom, one molecule, one organism — each isolated in Storybook, each validated against Figma, each pushed back to canvas. The last story composes the organisms into the full screen.

The installer never modifies BMad core or module files. It only writes to `_bmad/custom/`, `_bmad-output/`, and project-level paths.

## Installer flags

|---|---|
| `--file-key KEY` | Figma file key (the path segment after `/design/`) |
| `--file-name NAME` | Slug after the file key in URLs (display only) |
| `--atoms ID` | Atoms frame node-id, `N:NNN` form (e.g. `4:581`) |
| `--molecules ID` | Molecules frame node-id |
| `--organisms ID` | Organisms frame node-id |
| `--screen ID` | Full-screen frame node-id |
| `-y, --yes` | Non-interactive — fail on missing values rather than prompt |
| `-n, --dry-run` | Show what would happen, write nothing |
| `-f, --force` | Overwrite existing files (default: skip with warning) |

## Uninstall

The module installs ordinary files, so there's no automated uninstall:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
rm -rf docs/workflows/storybook-first-with-figma.{md,svg}
rm _bmad/custom/bmad-dev-story.toml
rm -rf _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/{README.md,sprint-status.yaml,1-*.md,_atom-story-template.md}
rm scripts/visual-check.mjs .mcp.json .env.example
# Then manually remove the appended block in .gitignore (between the two `# ---` markers)
```

---

## Versioning

See [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md). The module follows [semver](https://semver.org/): breaking changes bump major, new install steps or new template files bump minor, bug fixes and tweaks bump patch.
